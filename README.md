# Linear Media Player

Hey, thanks for taking the time to work on this exercise. We're excited to see what you come up with –
the goal is to create an audio player for playing a predefined playlist of audio files. Think of it
like a stripped-down version of Spotify or the classic Winamp.

### Getting started

Clone this repo which was created _just for you_, make it yours and let us know once the project is complete by pushing
your commits and replying through email. 

You can use `npm` to install the dependencies and run the basic React project. Feel free to add any additional libraries 
or frameworks you need.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Requirements

We'd like to see a working media player that can play through a playlist of audio files (included), display info on the
currently playing track and supporting basic functionality like play/pause, next track, etc. Beyond that, feel free to get
creative with the design and functionality.

Plan on spending 2-4 hours to complete this exercise.

Please update this README to include a screenshot of the completed exercise at the top.

### Playlist data

The playlist data is stored in `src/data/playlists.json`. It includes a list of audio files and some associated metadata,
you can import the json file directly with no need for network requests.
